How to float participant heads...

* SequenceDiagramFileMaker chooses UGraphics to use for given output file type. Eg UGraphicSvg (containing SvgGraphics).
* SvgGraphics code against w3c DOM API. Would be capable of generating new <g> elements or adding "id" attribute to
elements that are already currently generated.

* DrawableSetInitializer creates head, tail and line components using Rose (a Skin implementation). For head and tail
Rose creates a ComponentRoseParticipant instance for each head and tail. These are contained with a ParticipantBox that
writes the head then tail sequentially (in drawHeadTailU()), making it hard to group all heads in a single <g>.
* Could add startGroup(String id) and endGroup() to UGraphics to allow each head to go in a <g>. Eg
<g class="participant-head">. It currently has a createGroup() method but that returns a UGroup which presents a
narrow interface than UGraphic. No idea how this interface would work for other file types...

* Need to test whether header floating script can work by looking up individual participant heads by class name and
translate()'ing each of them.

How to allow arbitrary messages on a single participant line to be selected and show the time between each?
* ComponentRoseArrow draws the arrow. It knows the y positions of each arrow but doesn't appear to know which participants
are involved


How to make participant line fatter with respect to delay between messages?
* Would provide a visual clue in log-tool for the biggest delay in a transaction.
